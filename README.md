## Completed Technical Assignment: Movie Listing App

### Objective
Create a movie listing application using Vue.js that fetches a list of movies from the mock API and displays them.

### User Stories
- **View Movies**: As a user, I want to see a list of movies retrieved from the provided API.
- **Display Details**: Each movie listing should show the movie title, year, and IMDB id.
- **Pagination**: I want to navigate through the list using pagination with 10 items per page.
- **Search**: I should be able to search for movies by title.
- **Favorites**: I can mark a movie as favorite (star/unstar) and view all my favorite movies in a separate "Favourites" section.

### Requirements
- The application should be developed using either Vue 2 with the Composition API plugin or Vue 3.
- Components need to be implemented using the Composition API.
- TypeScript should be employed for scripting.
- Essential features must have both unit and end-to-end automated tests.
- The finished product should be published in a public GitHub repository.

**Note**: I dedicated approximately 7 hours to this assignment; therefore, it may not be in its perfect form (just becouse of 7hrs).
